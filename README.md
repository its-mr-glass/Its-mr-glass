# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Glass Knight

Iâ€™m a self-taught **AI engineer in training**, currently deep into an **18-month full-time self-study program** that blends both the science and engineering of artificial intelligence. My curriculum covers **Python programming**, **mathematics**, **algorithms**, **deep learning**, **real-world projects**, and **AI system deployment**. Iâ€™m focused on building intelligent systems that bridge software and hardware, from training neural networks and programming microcontrollers to deploying scalable, cloud-based architectures.

This journey is not just a personal challenge, but also the foundation for launching my own **AI-powered company**. I use this GitHub to document my progress, share projects, and showcase a portfolio grounded in hands-on learning and real-world applications.

Currently, Iâ€™m working with a **Linux laptop** that has limited resourcesâ€”4GB of RAM, a 300GB HDD, and a dual-core Intel Core i3 CPUâ€”which makes it difficult to run modern development tools or train larger models effectively. Despite these constraints, Iâ€™m committed to building impactful solutions and pushing the boundaries of what I can do with my current setup.

If you'd like to support my mission and help me upgrade my hardware, feel free to **buy me a coffee on Ko-fi**. Your support will go directly toward enhancing my capabilities and helping me advance on my self-taught journey towards building real-world AI systems.
