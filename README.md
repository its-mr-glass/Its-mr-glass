GitHub Bio (Refined Version):

> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lamar G., a self-taught AI engineer in training, currently immersed in an 18-month full-time self-study program that fuses the science and engineering of artificial intelligence.

My curriculum spans Python programming, mathematics, algorithms, deep learning, real-world projects, and AI system deployment. I focus on building intelligent systems that bridge software and hardware â€” from training neural networks and programming microcontrollers to deploying scalable, cloud-based architectures.

This journey is both a test of discipline and the foundation for launching my own AI-powered company. I use this GitHub to document my progress, share projects, and showcase a portfolio rooted in hands-on learning and practical application.
