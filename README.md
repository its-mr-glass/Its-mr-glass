> 👋 Hi, I’m Lamar G., a self-taught AI engineer in training, currently deep into an 18-month full-time self-study program that blends the science and engineering of artificial intelligence.

My curriculum covers Python programming, mathematics, algorithms, deep learning, real-world projects, and AI system deployment. I’m focused on building intelligent systems that bridge software and hardware — from training neural networks and programming microcontrollers to deploying scalable, cloud-based architectures.

This journey is both a personal challenge and the foundation for launching my own AI-powered company. I use this GitHub to document my progress, share projects, and showcase a portfolio grounded in hands-on learning and real-world application.

> 💻 At the moment, I’m working on a very limited setup — a Linux laptop with just 4GB RAM, a 300GB HDD, and a dual-core Intel Core i3 CPU. This restricts my ability to run modern development tools or train larger models effectively.

If you’d like to support my mission, consider buying me a coffee on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/glassknight). Your support goes directly toward upgrading my hardware and fueling my self-taught journey toward building real-world AI systems. 🙏
