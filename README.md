> 👋 Hi, I’m Lamar G., a self-taught AI engineer in training, currently immersed in an 18-month full-time self-study program that fuses the science and engineering of artificial intelligence.

My curriculum spans Python programming, mathematics, algorithms, deep learning, real-world projects, and AI system deployment. I focus on building intelligent systems that bridge software and hardware — from training neural networks and programming microcontrollers to deploying scalable, cloud-based architectures.

This journey is both a test of discipline and the foundation for launching my own AI-powered company. I use this GitHub to document my progress, share projects, and showcase a portfolio rooted in hands-on learning and practical application.

> 💻 I'm currently working on a modest setup — a Linux laptop with a 4GB RAM, 300GB HDD, and a dual-core Intel Core i3 CPU — which limits my ability to train larger models or run modern development environments smoothly.

If you’d like to support my journey, you can buy me a coffee on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/glassknight). Your support goes directly toward upgrading my hardware and staying on track with this ambitious self-taught mission. 🙏
