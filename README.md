Hi, I’m Lamar G. a dedicated, self-taught AI engineer in training. I’m currently pursuing an 18-month, full-time self-study program that blends the science and engineering of artificial intelligence. My curriculum spans Python, mathematics, algorithms, deep learning, real-world projects, and AI system deployment. I focus on building intelligent machines that integrate both software and hardware — from neural networks and microcontrollers to scalable, cloud-based systems. This journey is not only a test of discipline but also the groundwork for launching my own AI-powered company. I use this GitHub as a space to document my progress, showcase projects, and build a portfolio grounded in hands-on learning and practical application.
