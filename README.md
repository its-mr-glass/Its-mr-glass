Hi, I’m Lamar Glass — a dedicated self-taught AI engineer in training. I'm following an 18-month full-time study plan that combines AI science and engineering, from Python, math, and algorithms to deep learning, real-world projects, and AI system deployment. My focus is on building intelligent machines that blend software and hardware — from neural networks to microcontrollers and cloud-based systems. This journey is both a test of discipline and a foundation for launching my own AI-powered company. I use this GitHub as a space to document my progress, share projects, and build a portfolio rooted in hands-on learning and real-world application.
